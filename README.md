# cpython

Program which read from input sides ( A & B) of right-angled triangle
(hypotenuse² = A²+ B²)

Constrains:
• Lengths in the input file are foots (1 foot = 0.3048 meters)
• All lengths in the output file must be in meters.
• Number of the rows in the input file varies and overall length of the file is not limited.
• An operation system has not been chosen yet, so application must be implemented so,
that it is as easy to port as possible
• Format of the input file is:
legA LegB
5.9 1 4.51
5.10 6.82

• Format of the output file must be:
legA legB hypotenuse
30.48 30.48 43.1052

• Rows in the output file must be arranged according to the hypotenuse in ascending order.
